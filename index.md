## About me
My name is Lorenz Lechner. I work as a bicycle-courier and I am a FreeCAD enthusiast. My support for FreeCAD started in 2013 and includes the maintenance of conda-packages. In recent years I packaged a lot of dependencies for FreeCAD [1] and started to create packages of the latest source on every Sunday [2].
